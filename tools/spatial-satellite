Creating a spatial satellite with internet connectivity similar to Starlink would be a complex and involved process. Here are the general 
steps that would be involved:

 1) Define the requirements: Determine the exact specifications of the satellite, such as its size, weight, power requirements, and 
    capabilities. This would include deciding on the specific frequency bands to be used for communication and the type of antenna to be used.
  
 2) Design the satellite: Once the requirements have been defined, design the satellite itself. This would involve creating a detailed blueprint 
    of the satellite's physical structure, including the propulsion system, solar panels, and communication systems.
  
 3) Select components: Choose the specific components that will be used to build the satellite, such as the computer hardware, sensors, and 
    cameras. These components should be chosen based on their ability to perform in the harsh conditions of space.

 4) Build and test the satellite: Construct the satellite based on the design, and thoroughly test it to ensure that it meets all of the 
    requirements and functions correctly. This would involve testing the propulsion system, communication systems, and other critical components.

 5) Launch the satellite: Once the satellite has been built and tested, it needs to be launched into orbit. This can be done using a variety of
    methods, such as a rocket or a balloon.
 
 6) Establish communication: After the satellite is in orbit, it needs to establish communication with Earth-based stations to enable internet 
    connectivity. This would involve configuring the satellite's communication systems and ensuring that they are working properly.
 
 7) Operate the satellite: Once the satellite is operational, it needs to be monitored and controlled to ensure that it is functioning correctly and
    to make any necessary adjustments or repairs. This may involve working with ground-based teams to troubleshoot any issues that arise.
    
Overall, creating a spatial satellite with internet connectivity similar to Starlink is a complex and involved process that requires expertise 
in many different areas, including engineering, physics, and computer science. It would require a significant investment of time, money, and 
resources, as well as a deep understanding of the challenges and risks involved in operating in space.
