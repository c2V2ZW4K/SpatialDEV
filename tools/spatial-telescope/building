Creating a spatial telescope involves multiple steps, and it typically 
requires specialized knowledge in various areas, such as optics, 
mechanics, electronics, and software. Here are the general steps 
involved in creating a spatial telescope:

  1) Define the telescope's requirements: Start by defining the telescope's purpose, such as the intended objects to observe, the required spatial
     resolution, and the expected field of view. These requirements will dictate the telescope's design and components.

  2) Design the telescope's optical system: The optical system includes the primary mirror or lens, the secondary mirror, and any additional lenses 
     or mirrors required to correct for aberrations. The design must meet the requirements defined in step one.
     
  3) Fabricate and assemble the optical components: The mirrors and lenses must be carefully fabricated to the required specifications.
     The components are then assembled into the telescope's optical system, which must be aligned and tested.
  
  4) Design and build the mechanical structure: The telescope's mechanical structure must be designed to support the optical system
     and allow for precise pointing and tracking. This structure may include a mount, a tripod, and a drive system to move the telescope.
     
  5) Install and align the optical system: The optical system is carefully installed in the mechanical structure, and then it must be aligned and
     collimated to ensure that the light is properly focused on the detector.

  6) Install and test the detector: The detector records the light collected by the telescope, and it must be carefully selected and installed.
     Once installed, the detector must be tested to ensure that it meets the telescope's requirements.
   
  7) Build the control system: The telescope's control system includes the electronics and software required to operate the telescope and collect
     and analyze data. This system must be designed and built to meet the telescope's requirements.
     
  8) Test and calibrate the telescope: Once all components are installed and assembled, the telescope must be carefully tested and calibrated.
     This process includes testing the pointing and tracking accuracy, characterizing the optical system's performance, and optimizing
     the detector's settings.
     
   9) Commission and operate the telescope: Once the telescope has been tested and calibrated, it is ready for scientific observations.
      The telescope must be commissioned, which involves verifying its performance and establishing a standard operating procedure.
      After commissioning, the telescope can be operated to collect data for scientific research.

Creating a spatial telescope is a complex and challenging task that requires specialized expertise and equipment.
It typically involves collaboration among a team of experts in optics, mechanics, electronics, and software.

Defining the telescope's requirements:
the purpose is take one view in 360* of each side of telescope capting all lights emitted from vacuum spatial
Capturing a 360-degree view of all the lights emitted from the vacuum spatial would require a very specialized type of telescope
known as an all-sky telescope. This type of telescope typically has a very wide field of view and a curved focal plane that allows it
to capture images of the entire sky at once.
To design an all-sky telescope for this purpose, you would need to consider several requirements, including:

 Step 1) Spatial resolution: The telescope would need to be able to capture fine details in the light emitted from the vacuum spatial.
         This would likely require a high spatial resolution, which would in turn require a large aperture and a high-quality optical system.

 Step 2) Sensitivity: The telescope would need to be sensitive enough to detect very faint light sources.
         This would require a detector with a high quantum efficiency and low noise, as well as careful control of stray light.

 Step 3) Field of view: The telescope would need to have a very wide field of view to capture the entire sky at once.
         This would likely require a curved focal plane and specialized optics to correct for distortions.
 
 Step 4) Spectral range: Depending on the characteristics of the light emitted from the vacuum spatial,
         the telescope may need to be able to capture light across a wide spectral range. This would require a detector with a
         broad spectral response and specialized filters or dispersive elements in the optical system.

 Step 5) Data handling and storage: Capturing a 360-degree view of the sky would generate a large amount of data,
         so the telescope would need to be able to handle and store this data efficiently. This would likely require 
         specialized electronics and software for data acquisition, processing and storage.

Defining these requirements would help guide the design of the all-sky telescope and ensure that it meets the needs of the intended 
application.
